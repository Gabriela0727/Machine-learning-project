This project implements a machine learning classifier to predict diabetes in patients using the knn algorithm. It works with the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which has medical data from 768 female patients, each characterized by 8 health measurements like glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, age, and family history. The algorithm predicts whether a patient has diabetes by finding the K most similar patients in the training data, which is based on euclidean distance between their normalized medical measurements, and using a majority vote among those neighbors to make the prediction. The program automatically tests different values of K to find the optimal number of neighbors, splits the data into training and testing sets, and evaluates performance through accuracy metrics and a confusion matrix. When it runs, it achieves around 70% or higher accuracy in correctly identifying diabetes cases, displaying how accuracy changes with different K values through a matplotlib graph to help understand the trade off between overfitting and underfitting.
